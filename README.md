# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
## Analysis Overview
The purpose was to use deep-learning neural networks with TensorFlow platform in Python/Jupyter notebook to analyze and classify the success of charitable donations.
We use the following methods for the analysis:
* preprocessing the data for the neural network model,
* compile, train and evaluate the model,
* optimize the model.
